  Generate or revamp WSQ courseware slide decks for Tertiary Infotech Academy Pte Ltd.
  Use whenever building, revamping, or standardising a WSQ training PowerPoint (.pptx).
  Enforces the house standards: copyright line, organisation name + UEN on the front
  page, two "About the Trainer" variants (a blank General Trainer template and the
  named trainer) as visual profile cards, the correct admin slide order (Briefing for
  Assessment before the Assessment slide), a Lesson Plan slide, a mandatory professional
  visual component system (tile grids, flow diagrams, cards, profile cards — never plain

# WSQ Slides Skill

> **Scope:** This skill (with `wsq-learner-guide` and `wsq-lesson-plan`) applies to **all**
> Tertiary Infotech Academy WSQ courseware design — not just one course. Swap in the relevant
> course title, TGS code and content; keep the house standard below.

House standard for Tertiary Infotech Academy WSQ courseware decks. Apply ALL of the
rules below to every WSQ slide deck you create or revamp.

## HARD RULES (non-negotiable)

Every WSQ deck **must** satisfy all of the following. A deck that fails any of these does
not meet the WSQ house standard.

1. **Slides must ALWAYS be visual — never a wall of bullet text.** Build each slide from
   the [Visual design system](#visual-design-system-mandatory) components (tile grids,
   horizontal flow diagrams, colour-topped cards, profile cards, big statements,
   activity/step/verify slides, section dividers). Any slide that would be 4+ bullets of
   concept, outcome, process, comparison or trainer content **must** be converted to the
   matching component. Plain bullet lists are allowed **only** for genuinely list-like
   admin text (Learner Introduction, LMS instructions).

2. **Admin pages must be present** (see [Required elements](#required-elements) for detail):
   Title (org + UEN), Digital Attendance (TRAQOM · SSG), About the Trainer ×2, Learner
   Introduction, Ground Rules, Course Outline / Lesson Plan, Learning Outcomes, Briefing
   for Assessment, Assessment & Funding, and the LMS courseware/assessment slide.

3. **About the Trainer — two slides, as visual profile cards** (avatar badge + name/role
   panel + labelled info tiles): a blank **General Trainer** template and the **named
   trainer**. Never a plain bullet list.

4. **Assessment Flow must be a horizontal numbered flow diagram** (numbered chips joined
   by chevrons): TRAQOM → Assessment Digital Attendance → Assessment (WA then PP) →
   Submit on the LMS → Sign the Assessment Summary Record.

5. **TRAQOM · SSG Digital Attendance page must be present** (front of deck, and again at
   the end — see rule 6). TRAQOM = the SSG **digital attendance** system, not a survey.

6. **Assessment admin pages repeated at the END**, immediately before *Thank You*, in
   this order: **Assessment** (reminder) → **Assessment Flow** (the flow diagram) →
   **Digital Attendance (Mandatory)** (TRAQOM · SSG).

7. **Visual QA before delivery** — render the new/changed slides to images and inspect for
   overlap, clipping and balance.

8. **Import and reuse ALL the reference diagram components — never hand-roll slide layouts.**
   The deck MUST be built from the visual component helpers shipped in
   `reference/build_slides.py` — import/port **every** one of them into the course's
   `build_slides.py` and use the right component for each slide:
   `cover`, `section`, `content`, `two_col`, `cards3`, `tile_grid`, `flow_h`,
   `trainer_slide`, `big_statement`, `activity_overview`, `step_slide`, `test_slide` and
   `brk` (break/lunch dividers). Do **not** lay out shapes ad hoc, and do **not** fall back
   to a plain bullet slide where a diagram component fits. If the reference gains a new
   diagram type, adopt it too. Verify before delivery that the deck actually *uses* each
   component (e.g. `grep` the builder for every helper name).

## Reference implementation (use this to build PPT + LP + LG)

A complete, working **single-source build pipeline** ships with this skill at
**`reference/`** (installed at both the user level `~/.claude/skills/wsq-slides/reference/`
and the project level `.claude/skills/wsq-slides/reference/`). One content module
(`course_data.py` + `data_domainN.py`) drives **all three** artifacts so they never
drift: the slide deck (`build_slides.py` — contains every visual component helper), the
Lesson Plan (`build_lesson_plan.py`) and the Learner Guide (`build_learner_guide.py`),
plus the shared `prodoc.py` (WSQ cover page + version control + TOC + footer). For any new
WSQ course, **copy `reference/` into the course repo, edit the data modules, and re-run**
— see `reference/README.md`. The `wsq-lesson-plan` and `wsq-learner-guide` skills point
to this same reference.

## Organisation constants

- Organisation name: **Tertiary Infotech Academy Pte Ltd**
- UEN: **201200696W**
- Copyright line (footer of every slide): **© Tertiary Infotech Academy Pte Ltd**
- Contact: enquiry@tertiaryinfotech.com · +65 6100 0613 · www.tertiarycourses.com.sg
- LMS (courseware download + assessment): **https://lms-tms.tertiaryinfotech.com/**

## Required elements

1. **Copyright on every slide.** Put `© Tertiary Infotech Academy Pte Ltd` in the
   footer of every slide (title, dividers, content, activity and closing slides).

2. **Front / title page.** Show the course title, course code, trainer name, version,
   and the **organisation name + UEN** clearly on the title slide.

3. **About the Trainer — two slides, as visual profile cards** (not bullet lists).
   Use the **profile-card layout**: a left panel with a round **avatar badge**
   (initials for the named trainer, a neutral "?" for the template) plus the name and
   role, and a right column of **labelled info tiles** (one coloured tile per field).
   - A **General Trainer** template — neutral/grey theme, avatar "?", info tiles left
     blank with fill-in lines (fields: Name, Title/Designation, Qualifications, Areas
     of expertise, Training & industry experience, Contact) so any trainer can fill it in.
   - The **named trainer** (e.g. Dr. Alfred Ang) — accent theme, initials avatar, tiles
     filled with Role, Certification, Delivers, Founder (or equivalent).

4. **Admin slide order.** The **Briefing for Assessment** slide must come **before**
   the **Assessment / Final Assessment** slide.

5. **Lesson Plan slide.** Include a Lesson Plan slide showing the day's schedule
   (e.g. a time/session table, typically 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM with breaks). Follow the
   [Lesson plan & assessment scheduling](#lesson-plan--assessment-scheduling) rules below.

6. **Standard admin slides** to include where relevant: Digital Attendance,
   About the Trainer (×2), Learner Introduction, Ground Rules, Course Outline,
   Lesson Plan, Briefing for Assessment, Assessment & Funding, and a closing
   Certification & TRAQOM survey slide (ai-lms-tms.tertiaryinfo.tech).

7. **LMS slide.** Include a slide telling learners to **download the courseware**
   and **complete the assessment on the LMS** at **https://lms-tms.tertiaryinfotech.com/**.
   Place it near the end (e.g. before the Certification & TRAQOM survey slide).

8. **Assessment flow.** Render the procedure as a **horizontal numbered flow diagram**
   (numbered chips joined by chevrons — not a bullet list), in this order:
   (1) TRAQOM (scan the QR code on the LMS) → (2) Assessment Digital Attendance →
   (3) Assessment (WA then PP, open book) → (4) Submit the assessment answers on the LMS →
   (5) Sign the Assessment Summary Record. The TRAQOM QR code and the assessment
   submission are both on the LMS (https://lms-tms.tertiaryinfotech.com/).

9. **Assessment admin pages at the END of the deck.** Just before the closing
   *Thank You* slide, repeat the assessment admin block so it is fresh right before
   learners sit the assessment, in this order:
   1. **Assessment** — concise reminder (WA 1 hr · PP 1 hr, open book; take the
      Assessment digital attendance; submit on the LMS).
   2. **Assessment Flow** — the same horizontal numbered flow diagram as rule 8.
   3. **Digital Attendance (Mandatory)** — the TRAQOM · SSG digital-attendance page
      (same content as the front-of-deck attendance slide).
   Then the **Thank You** closing slide. (TRAQOM here = the SSG **digital attendance**
   system, not a survey.)

10. **Access the Labs slide.** If the course's hands-on labs live in a Git/GitHub
    repository, include an **"Access the Hands-On Labs"** slide that shows the course
    **GitHub repo URL as a REAL clickable hyperlink** (python-pptx: `run.hyperlink.address`),
    plus how to get the labs — **Option A** clone (`git clone <repo>.git`) and **Option B**
    download the ZIP (GitHub *Code → Download ZIP*) — as two colour-topped cards, and a note
    that the labs run free in the browser (e.g. Killercoda). Place it in the admin / hands-on
    intro (e.g. right after the workbench slide). The repo URL **must be clickable**, not
    plain text.

## Visual design system (mandatory)

Decks must look **professional and visual — never a wall of bullet text**. Build slides
from a small **component library** and reach for a component before a plain bullet list.
Reference implementation: the AZ-104 course `courseware/build/build_slides.py` helpers
(`tile_grid`, `flow_h`, `cards3`, `two_col`, `trainer_slide`, `big_statement`,
`activity_overview`, `step_slide`, `test_slide`, `section`).

**Required components** (use the right one for the content):
- **Section dividers** — a full-height accent bar, kicker, big title, oversized ghost number.
- **Tile grid** — a 2-column grid of light panels, each with a coloured numbered/icon
  badge, a left accent stripe, and a bold lead title + caption. Use for **Key Concepts,
  Learning Outcomes / What You Achieved, overviews, Ground Rules** — anything that would
  otherwise be a 4–6 item bullet list.
- **Horizontal flow diagram** — numbered chips joined by chevrons. Use for the
  **Assessment Flow** and any step-by-step process.
- **3-card layout** — three colour-topped cards (blue/teal/violet). Use for grouped
  comparisons (e.g. lab groupings, options).
- **Profile cards** — the About-the-Trainer layout (rule 3).
- **Big statement** — one bold sentence + supporting line, for "why it matters" beats.
- **Activity / Step / Verify** — coloured tag + description for each hands-on lab, a
  numbered-circle step slide (with an optional dark code block), and a green "✅ Test it"
  verify panel.

**Rules of thumb**
- Colours cycle through the house palette **blue → teal → violet → amber**; keep the
  all-white background and the footer/kicker system.
- A concept, outcomes, process or trainer slide must **not** be a plain `bullets`/`content`
  slide — convert it to the matching component above.
- Plain bullet slides are acceptable only for genuinely list-like admin content
  (e.g. Learner Introduction, LMS instructions).
- Always run visual QA: render the new/changed slides to images and inspect for overlap,
  clipping and balance before delivering.

## Recommended canonical order

1. Title (with org name + UEN)
2. Digital Attendance (TRAQOM · SSG)
3. About the Trainer — General (blank template, profile card)
4. About the Trainer — Named trainer (profile card)
5. Learner Introduction ("Let's know each other")
6. Ground Rules (tile grid)
7. Course Outline / Lesson Plan
8. Learning Outcomes (tile grid)
9. Briefing for Assessment
10. Assessment & Funding
11. Assessment Flow (horizontal flow diagram)
12. Access the Hands-On Labs (clickable GitHub repo link — if labs are in a repo)
13. … topic content + activities (each topic: section divider → Key Concepts tile grid → labs cards → activity/step/verify slides → recap) …
14. Summary / What You Achieved (tile grid)
15. Courseware & Assessment on the LMS (download courseware, take assessment)
16. Practice Exam (if available)
17. **Assessment** (end reminder — rule 9)
18. **Assessment Flow** (end flow diagram — rule 9)
19. **Digital Attendance (Mandatory)** — TRAQOM · SSG (end — rule 9)
20. Thank You

## Lesson plan & assessment scheduling

Every class ends at **6:00 PM**. Schedule the teaching content and activities to finish
before the assessment start time, then place the assessment at the end.

- **One-day class:** a **1-hour** assessment starts at **5:00 PM** (5:00 – 6:00 PM),
  made up of **30 min Written Assessment (WA) + 30 min Practical Performance (PP)**.
  Content and wrap-up must finish by 5:00 PM.
- **Two-day class:** a **2-hour** assessment starts at **4:00 PM** on the final day
  (4:00 – 6:00 PM), made up of **1 hr Written Assessment (WA) + 1 hr Practical
  Performance (PP)**. Content and wrap-up must finish by 4:00 PM.

To free up the time needed for the assessment block, you may compress the breaks:

- **Morning / afternoon breaks:** reduce to **10 minutes** each.
- **Lunch break:** reduce to **45 minutes**.

Always show the assessment block explicitly on the Lesson Plan slide (and in any
Lesson Plan document) with its start and end time.

## Design notes

- Build 16:9 (13.333 × 7.5 in). Either `python-pptx` (as the AZ-104 reference
  `build_slides.py` does) or `pptxgenjs` is fine — reuse the **Visual design system**
  component helpers above rather than laying out shapes ad hoc. See the `pptx` and
  `tertiary-ppt-design` skills for mechanics.
- Keep a clean, modern, all-white look with the house palette
  (blue `1F6FEB` · teal `10B981` · violet `7C3AED` · amber `F59E0B`); one kicker/accent
  per slide; consistent footer (course · code · © · page number).
- Prefer components (tile grid, flow diagram, cards, profile cards) over bullet walls —
  see the mandatory Visual design system section.
- Safe fonts: Arial throughout (Cambria/Calibri also acceptable); a monospace
  (Consolas / Courier New) for code blocks.
- Always run visual QA (render the new/changed slides to images, inspect for overlap and
  clipping) before delivering.
