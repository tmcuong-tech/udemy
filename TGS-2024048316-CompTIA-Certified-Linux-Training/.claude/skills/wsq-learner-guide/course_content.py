"""course_content.py — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for TGS-2024048316.

CompTIA Certified Linux+ Training (XK0-006 V8), delivered by Tertiary Infotech
Academy Pte Ltd. Every artifact — the PPT deck, the Lesson Plan (LP), the Learner
Guide (LG DOCX) and its Markdown mirror — is generated from the data below, so all
four stay 100% aligned to the 30 hands-on labs and the CompTIA exam domains.

The 30 labs (goal / build / concepts / step-by-step / test) are loaded from the
batch JSON files produced from the labs/ folder, keyed to the exam objectives.
