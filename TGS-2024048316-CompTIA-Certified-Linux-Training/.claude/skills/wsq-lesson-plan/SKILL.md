# WSQ Lesson Plan Skill

> **Scope:** This skill (with `wsq-slides` and `wsq-learner-guide`) applies to **all**
> Tertiary Infotech Academy WSQ courseware design — not just one course. Swap in the relevant
> course title, TGS code and content; keep the house format below.

House format for Tertiary Infotech Academy WSQ **Lesson Plan** documents. The deliverables
are a Microsoft Word `.docx` **and** a `.pdf` rendered from it — **no Markdown mirror** (HARD
RULE 4). Build the body in Markdown as a throwaway intermediate, then wrap it with the cover,
version-control record and a live Word TOC field (see [Build method](#build-method)).

## HARD RULES (non-negotiable)

1. **The Lesson Plan MUST cite the slide (page) numbers of the course deck.** The trainer
   uses the LP to run the class from the slides, so every teaching session must point to the
   matching deck pages:
   - The **Daily Schedule table** carries a **`Slides`** column giving the deck page range for
     each teaching row (e.g. `Slides 21–23`); use `—` for admin/break/assessment rows.
   - The **Topic-by-topic breakdown** shows the deck slide number on each activity/lab heading
     (e.g. `### Lab 6 — Containerization with Docker · Slide 26`) and the divider + range on
     each topic/domain heading.
   - Slide numbers must be **read from the actual built deck, not hand-typed** — the deck build
     writes a `slide_map.json` (lab/topic → page number) that the LP builder consumes, so the
     two never drift. Always build the slide deck **before** the Lesson Plan.
2. **Cover page, Document Version Control Record and a live Word TOC field** must all be present
   (see [Document structure](#document-structure-in-order)).
3. **Assessment scheduling** must match the deck / `wsq-slides` skill (see below).
4. **Deliverables are the DOCX and a PDF ONLY — never a Markdown mirror.** The only Lesson Plan
   artifacts kept in the repo are `LP-<course>.docx` and `LP-<course>.pdf` (rendered from the
   DOCX). Markdown may be used **only** as a throwaway build intermediate for pandoc and MUST be
   deleted once the DOCX is built — do **not** save or commit a `Lesson-Plan.md` / `LP-*.md`
   alongside the document.

## Reference implementation (shared, single-source)

The canonical **single-source build pipeline** for WSQ courseware (slide deck + **Lesson
Plan** + Learner Guide from one content module) ships with the `wsq-slides` skill at
`../wsq-slides/reference/` (installed at both `~/.claude/skills/wsq-slides/reference/` and
`.claude/skills/wsq-slides/reference/`). The Lesson Plan builder is
`reference/build_lesson_plan.py`; it reads `course_data.py` + `data_domainN.py` (the same
content that drives the deck and guide, so all three stay aligned) and uses `prodoc.py`
for the WSQ cover page, version-control record, TOC and footer. Copy `reference/` into the
course repo, edit the data modules, and run `python3 build_lesson_plan.py`. See
`reference/README.md`.

## Organisation constants

- Organisation name: **Tertiary Infotech Academy Pte Ltd**
- UEN: **201200696W**
- Contact: enquiry@tertiaryinfotech.com · +65 6100 0613 · www.tertiarycourses.com.sg
- LMS (courseware + assessment): **https://lms-tms.tertiaryinfotech.com/**

## Document structure (in order)

1. **Cover page** (all centred, single page, then a page break):
   - Organisation name — 13 pt bold
   - `UEN: 201200696W` — 10 pt
   - **LESSON PLAN** — 26 pt bold
   - `For` — 12 pt
   - Course title — 20 pt bold
   - `TGS Ref No: <code>` — 12 pt
   - `Conducted by` — 12 pt
   - Organisation name — 13 pt bold
   - `UEN: 201200696W` — 10 pt
   - `Version <x.y>` — 12 pt bold
2. **DOCUMENT VERSION CONTROL RECORD** (bold heading + bordered table, then page break).
   Columns: **Version Number | Effective Date of Release | Summary of Included Changes | Author**.
   One row per revision; convert relative dates to absolute (e.g. "27 Jun 2026").
3. **TABLE OF CONTENTS** (bold heading + a Word TOC field `TOC \o "1-3" \h \z \u`, then a
   page break). Set `w:updateFields val="true"` so Word offers to build it on open.
4. **Body** (uses Heading 1/2/3 styles so the TOC builds):
   - **Course Overview** — 1–2 sentences on the course.
   - **Learning Outcomes** — bulleted, "By the end of this course, participants will be able to…".
   - **Daily Schedule** — a table: **Time | Duration | Topic / Activity | Method | Slides**.
     The **Slides** column is mandatory (HARD RULE 1) — the deck page range per teaching row.
     Show breaks and the assessment block explicitly. For a one-day class use 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM.
   - **Topic-by-topic breakdown** — Heading 1 per topic, with sub-points and activities; put
     the **deck slide number on every activity/lab heading** (HARD RULE 1).
   - **Resources Required** — bulleted.
   - **Assessment** — WA + PP timings, start time, open-book, funding criteria, and the LMS link.

## Assessment scheduling (must match the deck / wsq-slides skill)

- Every class ends at **6:00 PM**. Schedule content to finish before the assessment.
- **One-day class:** 1-hour assessment at **5:00 PM** = **30 min WA + 30 min PP**.
- **Two-day class:** 2-hour assessment at **4:00 PM** on the final day = **1 hr WA + 1 hr PP**.
- To make room, breaks may be **10 min** and lunch **45 min**.
- Show the assessment block on the schedule table with its start and end time.
- Courseware and the assessment are on the LMS (https://lms-tms.tertiaryinfotech.com/).

See the **wsq-slides** skill for the slide-deck equivalents and the assessment flow
(TRAQOM → Attendance → Assessment → Submit answers → Sign the record).

## Build method

1. Write the body in Markdown as a **temporary intermediate** (e.g. a scratch `body.md`)
   starting at `## Learning Outcomes` (no cover/title in the body — the cover is generated
   separately).
2. `pandoc body.md -o body.docx` to get Heading-styled body content.
3. With `python-docx`, build a front-matter doc: cover page, version-control table, and a
   TOC field (raw OOXML `w:fldChar`/`w:instrText`).
4. Merge with **docxcompose** (`Composer(front).append(body)`), set `updateFields`, save.
5. Render the DOCX to PDF and QA the cover, version table and page breaks.
6. **Delete the intermediate Markdown** (HARD RULE 4) — keep only `LP-<course>.docx` and
   `LP-<course>.pdf`. Never leave a `Lesson-Plan.md` / `LP-*.md` in the repo.

Keep prose clean: no decorative formatting; mirror the wording style of the existing
`template/` documents in the project.
