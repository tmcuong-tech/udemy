# **Features**

## 1. **System Preparation**
* **Repository Synchronization**: Performs a comprehensive update and `dist-upgrade` to ensure all pending core packages and dependencies are fully patched.
* **Core Essentials**: Deploys a foundational toolkit including `wget`, `curl`, `htop`, and `vim`, while provisioning the OpenJDK environment for reverse engineering suites.
* **Dynamic Library Mapping**: Configures `apt-file` to resolve missing shared objects and headers, preventing compilation errors in a flat Linux environment.

## 2. **System & Network Hardening**
* **Kernel Parameter Tuning**: Programmatically audits `/etc/sysctl.conf` to disable IP redirects, log martian packets, and enforce protected symlinks/hardlinks.
* **Restricted Visibility**: Implements a "default deny" UFW firewall policy to eliminate unsolicited inbound connections, ensuring stealth during active engagements.
* **Compliance Monitoring**: Integrates [Lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis/) to facilitate automated system auditing and identify security configuration drift.

## 3. **Integrity Checking**
* **Binary Hash Auditing**: Utilizes `debsums` for a high-speed verification of the MD5 hashes for all files located in critical `/bin` and `/sbin` directories.
* **Package Cross-Referencing**: Automatically maps system binaries to their respective `dpkg` owners to ensure only authentic, unmodified packages are operational.

## 4. **Modern Forensics & Tool Utility**
* **Volatility 3 Deployment**: Clones and links the latest Volatility 3 framework from source, ensuring compatibility with modern memory dump formats and symbols.
* **Exploitation Readiness**: Automates `msfdb` initialization for high-speed Metasploit database queries and configures global symlinks for custom Python forensics tools.
* **Automated OSINT**: Clones the [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) framework and manages specialized Python dependencies using pip-break-system-package protocols.

## 5. **Automated Setup & Logging**
* **Non-Containerized Installation**: Orchestrates a direct offensive suite deployment, avoiding the performance overhead of virtualization or container layers.
* **Error Persistence**: Maintains a detailed `errors.log` to capture standard error (stderr) from failed command executions for rapid troubleshooting.
* **Artifact Purging**: Executes a multi-stage cleanup using `autoremove` and `clean` to reclaim disk space by removing orphaned dependencies and local package caches.

# Update for Kali 2026.1
* **Updating Existing Tools**: Use `apt-get full-upgrade -y` instead of `dist-upgrade`. This is Kali’s native rolling-distribution upgrade mechanism. It updates your installed packages and resolves dependency shifts safely.
* **Adding Missing Tools**: Filtered out the massive list of tools already built into the default Kali image (like nmap, wireshark, and metasploit). The script now explicitly targets specialized tools that do not come pre-installed but are essential for deep security research (like amass, apktool, subfinder, and bloodhound.py).
* **Removing Unnecessary Stuff Safely**: Instead of using a blind `autoremove` (which frequently deletes core system components by mistake), the script explicitly purges known telemetry, unused debug tools, and legacy services that bloat a research machine.
